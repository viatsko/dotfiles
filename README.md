# Valerii's dotfiles

* I maintain this repo as *my* dotfiles, but I'm keenly aware people are using it for theirs.
* You're quite welcome to make suggestions, however I may decline if it's not of personal value to me.

## WSL

* .zsh might break if dotfiles were fetched to Windows file system, use Linux internal one to store them

## Additional software

* [Helium](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/helium/id1054607607?mt=12)
* [Kap](https://github.com/wulkano/kap/releases)
